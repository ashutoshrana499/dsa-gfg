# Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Typescript. 
 
This repository is a demonstration of my work where i have solved atleast 1-2 problems a day. This repository will help anyone to challenge yourself and do a DS-A problem a day.

All the solutions are in typescript which you can transpile to es2015 version also.

#Install
1. npm install
2. npm run build 


[Stacks](./src/stack)
   * [Implement a Stack using Array](./src/stack/stack.ts "(target|_blank)")
   * [Implement a Stack using Linked List](./src/stack/stack-node.ts)
   * [Implement 2 stacks in one array](./src/stack/two-stacks.ts)
   * [Remove consecutive Duplicates](./src/stack/remove-consecutive-duplicates.ts)

[Queues](./src/queue)
   * [Implement a Queue using Array](./src/queue/queue.ts)
   * [Implement a Queue using Linked List](./src/queue/queue-node.ts)
   * [Implement a LRU Cache](./src/queue/lru-cache.ts)
   * [Maximum of all subarrays of size k](./src/queue/maximum-subarrays.ts)
   * [Reverse First K elements of Queue](./src/queue/reverse-k-elements.ts)

>The problems are taken from <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks</a>. It contains solutions to most of the problems in C++/Java and would recommend as the go to site for learning data structures and algorithms.
